COMPOSITE FOUR

COMPOSITE TYPES

Arrays, slices, maps, structs

Arrays, Structs -> Aggregate types -> their values are concatenations of other values in memory. Arrays are homogeneous but structs are heterogeneous. And Both are fixed size.


** ARRAY

An array is a fixed length sequence of zero or more elements of a particular type.

var a [3]int -> an array of three integer
len(a) -> returns the number of elements in the array
by default elements of array are initially set to the zero value, and we can use array literal to initialize an array with values.

var q [3]int = [3]int{1, 2, 3}

In an array literal you can do this -> 
q := [...]int{1,2,3}
which means that the length of the array will be the same as the number of initializers.

* the size of a array it part of its type so [2]int and [3]int are not the same 

r := [...]int{99: -1} -> defines an array with one hundred elements, all zeros except for the last.

if array's element types is comparable then the array type is comparable

* when a function is called a copy of each argument value is assigned to the corresponding parameter variable, SO FUNCTION WILL RECEIVE A COPY NOT THE ORIGINAL, and considering this passing large array can be insufficient. also all the changes function make is only affects the copy not the original array * BUT WE CAN PASS THE POINTER TO THE ARRAY so that any modification the function makes to array elements will be visible to the caller.

Using pointer to an array is efficient and allows the called function to mutate the caller's variable.



** SLICES

Slices represent variable length sequence whose elements all have the same type. 
slice type -> []T -> it looks like an array type without size

A slice has three components: pointer, length, capacity

The pointer points to the first element of the array that is reachable through the slice

The length is the number of slice elements

The capacity is something???

len, cap are two built-in functions that return length and capacity

s[i:j] 0 <= i <= j <= cap(s) -> it create a new slice that refers to elements i through j-1  

slicing beyond cap cause panic - but slicing beyond len extends the slice.

* The expression x[m:n] yields a string if x is a string, or a []byte if x is a []byte

* consider a slice has a pointer to an array so passing a slice to a function permits the function to modify the underlying array elements.

THIS IS IMPORTANT
s := []int{1,2,3,4,5,6}
Consider the diffs between initializing slice and array. a slice literal looks like an array literalm a squence of values separated by commas and surrounded by braces BUT the size is NOT GIVEN. This implicitly creates an array variable of the right size(**so first an array is created**) and then yields a slice that points to it.

Unlike arrays, slices are not comparable. so we cannot use ==. but we have bytes.Equal function for comparing two slices of bytes. but for comparing slices with other type we should do it ourselves.

The only legal slice comparison is against nil.

the zero value of slice type is nil The nul slice has length and capacity zero. BUT consider there are also non-nil slices of length and capacity zero. example -> []ion{}

* SO PAY ATTENTION if you need to test a slice is empty or not use len(s) == 0
DO NOT USE s == nil

The make function creates a slice of a specified element type, length and capacity.

make([]T, len, cap)
