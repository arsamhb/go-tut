go run file-name.go -> compiles the code and then run it
go build file-name.go -> compiles the code once and you can use it later

PACKAGE
go is package based
each .go source file starts with a package declaration
package main is special -> it defines a standalone executable program
also function main is special 
import tells the compiler what packages we is needed 

FUNCTION
func - a keyword for function declaration

THERE IS A gofmt TOOL ?? what it does? Learn to use this guy? you can config vscode to run this on each control+S do this config

OS PACKAGE
os.Args

FOR
for initialization; condition; post {

}
in for loop you can use range keyword to describe something to iterate on
this range produces two elements  -index -value at the index
_, arg = range array -> this _ is a blank identifier

BLANK IDENTIFIER
we use _ when the syntax needs the declaration but the logic does not

s := "" syntax is only allowed within a function


STRINGS PACKAGE
string.Join() -> takes a list in first argument and concatenate them with the second argument

* slices will be printed in []

VERBS FOR Printf 
%d  %X  %o  %b  %f  %g  %e  %t  %c  %s  %q  %v  %T  %%

functions whose name ends with f use the formatting rules of fmt
those whose name ends with ln formatting their arguments as if by %v, followed by a newline

BUFIO PACKAGE
this package has .NewScanner() and if we pass os.Stdin as argument it can accept inputs from user

len(something) -> tells us the length of something
